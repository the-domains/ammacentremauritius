# **Types of Puja**

**Amma says that her path is "love" and her religion is "love and selfless service".** However for those who want to seek solace through some of the vedic practices such as pujas and homas, the following services are available. These pujas are certainly beneficial to those who have faith in them. It would be ideal if we pray that all our pujas lead us to the path of love that Amma shows us all the time.

"The malefic planetary conjunctions are the phases in one's life when one's aura gets darkened. Such a person is like one groping in the darkness. His thoughts and activities are misguided. The vibrations radiating from him displease others. It is possible to reduce the suffering due to the unfavorable position of planets through sincere reliance on God, the One who controls the planets. The Indwelling Lord cannot turn a deaf ear to a soulful prayer said with an open heart."
