# What People Say

My father and Amma are kindred spirits.

_~ Ms. Yolanda King_

_Daughter of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr._

Amma is the embodiment of pure love. Her presence heals.

~ Dr. Deepak Chopra, M.D.

In all my life, I have not met a warmer personality than Amma. Even an agnostic like me had great difficulty in holding back my tears.

~ Sri. Khuswant Singh

Author and Journalist

Amma presents the kind of leadership we need for our planet to survive. This is the most heroic person I've probably ever met.

~ Alice Walker

Pulitzer Prize Winner

Amma has done more work than many governments have ever done for their people... her contribution is enormous.

~ Prof. Muhammad Yunus

2006 Nobel Peace Prize Winner  
Founder, Grameen Bank

Amma is truly such an enormous fountain of energy, love and compassion. I think if all of us were to get even a fraction of it within our own beings, there would be only joy in the whole world... Whatever little I can do with her inspiration, I will strive my best to accomplish it.

~ Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri

2007 Nobel Peace Prize Winner,  
Chairman, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

With great force, she took me in her arms and I was enveloped in a scent of rose. It was a powerful hug, a powerful moment, really. Overcome with a profound sense of comfort, clarity and calm, I staggered off stage and sat down.

~ NPR Reporter Allison Bryce
