description: >-
  Mata Amritanandamayi was born in a remote coastal village in Kerala, South
  India in 1953.Even as a small girl, she drew attention with the many hours she
  spent in deep meditation on the seashore. She also composed devotional songs
  and could often be seen singing to the divine with heartfelt emotion. Despite
  her tender age, her compositions revealed remarkable depth and wisdom.When she
  was nine years old, her mother became ill, and Mata Amritanandamayi was
  withdrawn from school in order to help with household tasks and the care of
  her seven siblings. As she went door-to-door gathering food scraps from
  neighbors for her family’s cows, she was confronted with the intense poverty
  and suffering that existed in her community, and in the world beyond it.Where
  Mata Amritanandamayi encountered people in need, she brought them food and
  clothing from her own home. She was undeterred by the scolding and punishment
  she received from her family for doing so. She also began to spontaneously
  embrace people to comfort them in their sorrow. Responding to her affectionate
  care, they began to call her Amma (Mother).Amma was deeply affected by the
  profound suffering she witnessed. According to Hinduism, the suffering of the
  individual is due to his or her own karma — the results of actions performed
  in the past. Amma accepted this concept, but she refused to accept it as a
  justification for inaction. Amma contemplated the principle of karma until she
  revealed an even more profound truth, asking a question she continues to ask
  each of us today. “If it is one man’s karma to suffer, isn’t it our dharma
  (duty) to help ease his suffering and pain?”With this simple yet profound
  conviction — that each of us has a responsibility to lend a helping hand to
  those less fortunate — Amma moved forward with confidence in her life of
  service and compassionate care for all beings, uniquely expressed by the
  motherly embrace she offers to all who seek solace in her arms.In Amma’s
  community, however, it was not permissible for a 14-year-old girl to touch
  others, especially men. Amma explains, "In India, women are expected to remain
  in the background. It is said that 'Even the walls should not hear them.' My
  family could not understand my way of reaching out to people; they had no idea
  of the spiritual principles."But despite adverse reactions, Amma followed her
  heart, later explaining, “A continuous stream of love flows from me to all of
  creation. This is my inborn nature. The duty of a doctor is to treat patients.
  In the same way, my duty is to console those who are suffering.”Amma says that
  love expressed is compassion, and compassion means accepting the needs and
  sorrows of others as one's own.
