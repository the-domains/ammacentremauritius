title: About Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi)
publisher: {}
description: >-
  Mata Amritanandamayi was born in a remote coastal village in Kerala, South
  India in 1953.  Even as a small girl, she drew attention with the many hours
  she spent in deep meditation on the seashore. She also composed devotional
  songs and could often be seen singing to the divine with heartfelt emotion.
  Despite her tender age, her compositions revealed remarkable depth and
  wisdom.  When she was nine years old, her mother became ill, and Mata
  Amritanandamayi was withdrawn from school in order to help with household
  tasks and the care of her seven siblings. As she went door-to-door gathering
  food scraps from neighbors for her family’s cows, she was confronted with the
  intense poverty and suffering that existed in her community, and in the world
  beyond it.  Where Mata Amritanandamayi encountered people in need, she brought
  them food and clothing from her own home. She was undeterred by the scolding
  and punishment she received from her family for doing so. She also began to
  spontaneously embrace people to comfort them in their sorrow. Responding to
  her affectionate care, they began to call her Amma (Mother).  Amma was deeply
  affected by the profound suffering she witnessed. According to Hinduism, the
  suffering of the individual is due to his or her own karma — the results of
  actions performed in the past. Amma accepted this concept, but she refused to
  accept it as a justification for inaction. Amma contemplated the principle of
  karma until she revealed an even more profound truth, asking a question she
  continues to ask each of us today. “If it is one man’s karma to suffer, isn’t
  it our dharma (duty) to help ease his suffering and pain?”  With this simple
  yet profound conviction — that each of us has a responsibility to lend a
  helping hand to those less fortunate — Amma moved forward with confidence in
  her life of service and compassionate care for all beings, uniquely expressed
  by the motherly embrace she offers to all who seek solace in her arms.  In
  Amma’s community, however, it was not permissible for a 14-year-old girl to
  touch others, especially men. Amma explains, "In India, women are expected to
  remain in the background. It is said that 'Even the walls should not hear
  them.' My family could not understand my way of reaching out to people; they
  had no idea of the spiritual principles."  But despite adverse reactions, Amma
  followed her heart, later explaining, “A continuous stream of love flows from
  me to all of creation. This is my inborn nature. The duty of a doctor is to
  treat patients. In the same way, my duty is to console those who are
  suffering.”  Amma says that love expressed is compassion, and compassion means
  accepting the needs and sorrows of others as one's own.
