Water from the overflowing Adyar river submerged the houses in the adjacent areas, to the extent of about one kilometer on either side
    of the river. The havoc has affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>In the wake of the colossal loss and damages due to the unprecedented rains in Chennai and parts of Tamil Nadu, ETW donated INR 50 Million ($749,000 USD) towards the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for relief and rehabilitation activities.</p><p>As directed by Amma, ETW volunteers have been actively participating in the relief work from the last week of November. Starting December 1st, around 500 volunteers comprising of students &amp; faculties have been involved in relief activities including
    rescuing the stranded to safer places, distribution of food, medicines, essential provisions, utensils, stove, clothes, blankets, toiletries and other essentials in badly affected areas.</p><p>A Telemedicine van, two fully equipped ambulances which includes a cardiac unit, an emergency unit, a testing unit to detect epidemic diseases in two minutes, colour ultra sonography, X-ray radiography, mini operation theater, small delivery room, electro-cardiography
    and light microscopy along with a 25-member team of doctors and paramedics from Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences reached Chennai today and plunged into service of providing medical help. Every day the team attends 700 to 800 patients.</p><p>Related Links - <a href="http://amma.org/news/flood-relief-chennai">Chennai Relief Efforts</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/update-chennai-flood-relief-efforts">Update on Relief Efforts</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/chennai-flood-relief-efforts-continue">ETW donates INR 50M towards Chennai Flood Relief Efforts.</a></p><p><strong>Nepal Earthquake Relief Efforts - April 2015</strong></p><p>A powerful earthquake shook Nepal on Saturday, April 25, 2015, near its capital, Katmandu, killing more than 1,900 people, flattening sections of the city’s historic center, and trapping dozens of sightseers in a 200-foot watchtower that came crashing
    down into a pile of bricks.</p><p>In the wake of the devastating earthquake in Nepal the ETW (Mata Amritanandamayi Mat in India) was also there and came forward with an offer to help. Amma immediately sent representatives to Nepal to assess the situation and help in whatever way possible.
    ETW was engaged in providing basic provisions – Rice, Dal, Clothing, Blankets, etc. Seeing that the devastation had made many in the villages homeless, Amma arranged for providing tin sheets for roofing – with an aim to serve as temporary shelter,
    which could later be used as part of their permanent housing too.</p><p>Additionally Amma also arranged for 1,00,000 Toxicoid Tetanus Vaccines and 1,00,000 ATT Vaccines to prevent and treat post-disaster infections.Apart from the vaccine, the ETW has donated two tons of essential medicines and surgical items to the Bir Hospital,
    the biggest Govt. Hospital in Nepal. Thus far, this is the single largest supply of ATT vaccine provided by any aid organization since the earthquake struck.</p><p>Related Links - <a href="http://amma.org/news/embracing-world-starts-relief-efforts-nepal-disaster">Earthquake devastates Nepal</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/nepal-earthquake-relief-efforts">ETW plunges into relief work.</a></p><p><strong>Jammu &amp; Kashmir Flood Relief Efforts - October 2014</strong></p><p>After devastating floods swept through the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Embracing the World responded immediately, sending volunteers to the affected area to provide essential aid and to assess with local government officials the best way our efforts
    can support survivors of the floods. Within weeks of the initial assessment, Amma pledged a $4 million USD relief package that included construction of houses for those displaced by the flood, as well as monetary aid for widows, medical care and essential
    supplies.

In response, we announced a $10.7 million relief package for the flood survivors
    in both states. Just 20 days after entering into an agreement with the Government of Karnataka to provide new homes for displaced flood survivors there, we had already completed 100 new houses. And that was just the beginning. Medical care for more

    of tents, blankets and tarpaulins along with cooking stoves and vessels, food, clothing and school supplies. A government official there commented about our volunteers, "I wonder if they are even sleeping at night! We are very thankful to them for

    What made our work unique was its holistic nature—every aspect of the tsunami survivors’ lives was considered and improved. In the end, many survivors stated that in terms of their quality of life and economic independence, they were better off after

Amma’s centers in many countries contribute to this humanitarian effort by inspiring people to serve selflessly in the building of a better world.</p>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"d6ef3aef-51a8-4e7d-9b64-6a30936532a7","item":"12447f73-c74f-4a8a-a05e-224239f1f5df","type":"h3","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-27T14:41:53.666Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"HOW WE BEGAN","_html":"<h3><strong>HOW WE BEGAN</strong></h3>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"b9a9bfbc-d5cb-4d13-9c14-a6684445cbed","item":"12447f73-c74f-4a8a-a05e-224239f1f5df","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-27T14:41:53.666Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"Each project began in response to the needs of the world’s poor who came to unburden their hearts to Amma and cry on her shoulder.","_html":"<p>Each project began in response to the needs of the world’s poor who came to unburden their hearts to Amma and cry on her shoulder.</p>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"fca3566d-fe68-4ddf-b1b3-7345c22e7dfe","item":"12447f73-c74f-4a8a-a05e-224239f1f5df","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-27T14:41:53.666Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"More than 20 years ago, the administrators of a local orphanage confessed to Amma they were out of funds and that before long, they would have to turn the children out on the street.","_html":"<p>More than 20 years ago, the administrators of a local orphanage confessed to Amma they were out of funds and that before long, they would have to turn the children out on the street.</p>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"5acbf7e9-3b2a-49d2-bfb1-8efab9d96184","item":"12447f73-c74f-4a8a-a05e-224239f1f5df","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-27T14:41:53.666Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"Amma diverted money that had been saved to build her first prayer hall and used it to assume care of the orphans.
