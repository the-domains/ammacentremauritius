</picture><h2>What We've Accomplished</h2><p><strong>Chennai Flood Relief Efforts, December 2015</strong></p><p>Due to the incessant heavy rains, many low lying areas of Chennai city got inundated on the late night of 1st December. Water from the overflowing Adyar river submerged the houses in the adjacent areas, to the extent of about one kilometer on either side
    of the river. The havoc has affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>In the wake of the colossal loss and damages due to the unprecedented rains in Chennai and parts of Tamil Nadu, ETW donated INR 50 Million ($749,000 USD) towards the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for relief and rehabilitation activities.</p><p>As directed by Amma, ETW volunteers have been actively participating in the relief work from the last week of November. Starting December 1st, around 500 volunteers comprising of students &amp; faculties have been involved in relief activities including
    rescuing the stranded to safer places, distribution of food, medicines, essential provisions, utensils, stove, clothes, blankets, toiletries and other essentials in badly affected areas.</p><p>A Telemedicine van, two fully equipped ambulances which includes a cardiac unit, an emergency unit, a testing unit to detect epidemic diseases in two minutes, colour ultra sonography, X-ray radiography, mini operation theater, small delivery room, electro-cardiography
    and light microscopy along with a 25-member team of doctors and paramedics from Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences reached Chennai today and plunged into service of providing medical help. Every day the team attends 700 to 800 patients.</p><p>Related Links - <a href="http://amma.org/news/flood-relief-chennai">Chennai Relief Efforts</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/update-chennai-flood-relief-efforts">Update on Relief Efforts</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/chennai-flood-relief-efforts-continue">ETW donates INR 50M towards Chennai Flood Relief Efforts.</a></p><p><strong>Nepal Earthquake Relief Efforts - April 2015</strong></p><p>A powerful earthquake shook Nepal on Saturday, April 25, 2015, near its capital, Katmandu, killing more than 1,900 people, flattening sections of the city’s historic center, and trapping dozens of sightseers in a 200-foot watchtower that came crashing
    down into a pile of bricks.</p><p>In the wake of the devastating earthquake in Nepal the ETW (Mata Amritanandamayi Mat in India) was also there and came forward with an offer to help. Amma immediately sent representatives to Nepal to assess the situation and help in whatever way possible.
    ETW was engaged in providing basic provisions – Rice, Dal, Clothing, Blankets, etc. Seeing that the devastation had made many in the villages homeless, Amma arranged for providing tin sheets for roofing – with an aim to serve as temporary shelter,
    which could later be used as part of their permanent housing too.</p><p>Additionally Amma also arranged for 1,00,000 Toxicoid Tetanus Vaccines and 1,00,000 ATT Vaccines to prevent and treat post-disaster infections.Apart from the vaccine, the ETW has donated two tons of essential medicines and surgical items to the Bir Hospital,
    the biggest Govt. Hospital in Nepal. Thus far, this is the single largest supply of ATT vaccine provided by any aid organization since the earthquake struck.</p><p>Related Links - <a href="http://amma.org/news/embracing-world-starts-relief-efforts-nepal-disaster">Earthquake devastates Nepal</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/nepal-earthquake-relief-efforts">ETW plunges into relief work.</a></p><p><strong>Jammu &amp; Kashmir Flood Relief Efforts - October 2014</strong></p><p>After devastating floods swept through the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Embracing the World responded immediately, sending volunteers to the affected area to provide essential aid and to assess with local government officials the best way our efforts
    can support survivors of the floods. Within weeks of the initial assessment, Amma pledged a $4 million USD relief package that included construction of houses for those displaced by the flood, as well as monetary aid for widows, medical care and essential
    supplies. By October 6, our tertiary care hospital in Kochi, Amrita Hospital, had sent two telemedicine units equipped with health and relief facilities to the disaster zone.</p><p>Related Links - <a href="http://amma.org/news/medical-relief-camps-jammu-and-kashmir-flood-survivors">Medical Relief Camps in Jammu &amp; Kashmir</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/community-center-flood-ravaged-village">Community Center in flood ravaged village</a></p><p><strong>Typhoon Haiyan Relief Efforts in Philippines - November 2013</strong></p><p>Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, was one of strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, devastating Philippines in early November 2013. It is considered the deadliest Philippine typhoon recorded in history.</p><p>Amma on behalf of Embracing the World, pledged a million dollar USD relief and rehabilitation package for the people of Philippines. In collaboration with the Philippines Disaster Recovery Foundation (PDRF), we have made children’s welfare, safety, and
    education our top priorities. Several initiatives are underway including creating sustainable development programs, rebuilding schools, renovating destroyed classrooms, building typhoon shelters for communities, and enhancing disaster preparedness
    and responsiveness in schools. In order to create the greatest impact, our outreach efforts are not limited to one area, but are occurring throughout 6 major provinces in the Philippines.</p><p>Related Links - <a href="http://amma.org/news/amma-dedicates-2-million-aid-philippines">Amma pledges $1 million USD</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/building-back-better">Building back better.</a></p><p><strong>Uttarkhand Flood Relief Efforts - June 2013</strong></p><p>Embracing the World launched <strong>an eight million dollar relief-and-rehabilitation program</strong> to help victims of the Kedarnath flash-flooding and landslides in June.</p><p>ETW started its Kedarnath-region relief-and-rehabilitation soon after the flooding. By July 1 of 2013, a team of volunteers—including doctors, nurses and monastic disciples set up a base camp at Agastya Muni in the Rudraprayag District.</p><p>More doctors, nurses, techs and other volunteers soon joined the team, and an ambulance and telemedicine van were sent from AIMS ( ETW's super-specialty hospital in Kochi, Kerala.) ETW volunteers provided free medical consultations and medicine to approximately
    8,000 people in the disaster-stuck area from July 1 – 20.</p><p>Aside from this basecamp, the ETW volunteers also travelled to a number of other villages to provide medical care, including Siddha Saur, Rudraprayag, Devli, Lambgondi, Andrewadi, Triyuginarayan, Toshi, Basukedar, Chandrapuri and Laksar.</p><p>Through this relief-and-rehabilitation package, ETW will build approximately 500 houses, the sum total of all the homes destroyed by the flooding. These homes will be built on common sites provided by the Uttarakhand State Government.</p><p>Related Links - <a href="http://amma.org/news/8m-flood-relief-victims-kedarnath-flood">ETW pledges $8M towards Flood Relief Efforts</a>, <a href="http://amma.org/news/japanese-student-volunteer-rehabilitation-kedarnath">Japanese students help with rehabilitation</a>,

    in both states. Just 20 days after entering into an agreement with the Government of Karnataka to provide new homes for displaced flood survivors there, we had already completed 100 new houses. And that was just the beginning. Medical care for more
    than 500 people was provided each day.</p><p><strong>$465,000 Aid Package for Flood Refugees: North India Bihar Floods, 2008</strong></p><p>In 2008, one million people were rendered homeless in Bihar when the Kosi River over- flowed its banks. We pledged $465,000 in relief. Our medical teams remained on the ground for more than two months, treating 50,000 people. We also distributed thousands
    of tents, blankets and tarpaulins along with cooking stoves and vessels, food, clothing and school supplies. A government official there commented about our volunteers, "I wonder if they are even sleeping at night! We are very thankful to them for
    accepting our appeal and rushing to help us in this time of need."</p><p><strong>$1 Million to Bush-Clinton Katrina Relief Fund: Hurricane Katrina, 2005</strong></p><p>Following hurricanes Katrina and Rita, more than 100 Embracing the World service groups throughout North America responded by delivering food, clothing, school supplies and other essential items to the refugees. Our volunteers visited relief sites and
    provided medical care and emotional support. We also helped the displaced to locate one another via a dedicated website we built for the survivors. In December 2005, we donated $1 million to the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund.</p><p><strong>$46 Million relief aid package to the tsunami survivors</strong>:<strong>Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2004</strong></p><p>The relief and rehabilitation work conducted by Embracing the World in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami stands today as one of the most multi-faceted, comprehensive and sustained disaster-relief projects ever undertaken by a nongovernmental organization.
    What made our work unique was its holistic nature—every aspect of the tsunami survivors’ lives was considered and improved. In the end, many survivors stated that in terms of their quality of life and economic independence, they were better off after
    the tragedy than they had been before.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="68"><!-- react-empty: 69 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="70"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="71"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="72"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="73"><span data-reactid="74"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="75"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e369875b-215e-433d-bd92-ad6afc65d88e.jpg" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="76"/></a><h2 data-reactid="77"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="78">ammacentremauritius</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="79"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="80"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="81"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
